# Hype.AI

This is a parody of of AI industry hype inspired by [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) and [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). It's made in React Native for the [Inbound Shovel game jam](https://itch.io/jam/shovel-jam-2025).


# Theme

The theme for this jam was **Just Get Started**.  It matches the theme in two ways: In the game you're a startup that just opened, and in real life I needed to learn React Native so I just got started on something.
