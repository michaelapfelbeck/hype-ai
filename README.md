# Hype.AI

This is a parody of of AI industry hype inspired by [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) and [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). It's made in React Native for the [Inbound Shovel game jam](https://itch.io/jam/shovel-jam-2025).


# Theme

The theme for this jam was **Just Get Started**.  It matches the theme in two ways: In the game you're a startup that just opened, and in real life I needed to learn React Native so I just got started on something.


# Games Phases

## Phase 1 - Startup

In this phase you're a promising AI startup. 

Gameplay-wise you're buying GPUs for compute power to run AI models to earn money to buy more GPUs. Eventually financing an IPO and moving to phase 2.

## Phase 2 - Conquest

In this phase you've gone public as a company. Your building the AI infrastructure that powers the new world you're creating. While simultaneously foisting unempoyment on the masses and engaging in corporate manouvering to take out competing firms.

Gameplay wise you're building cororate offices and datacenters to exand your office. While also building hype around your projects.

## Phase 3 - Bunker

You've effectively taken over the world. Now it's time to build you apocapypse bunker to wait out the inevitable doom you've caused. You must copmlete you bonker before worldwide unrest reaches it's peak and teh masses tear you apart.
